#' winnerscurse: Winner's Curse Adjustment Methods for Summary Statistics from Genome-Wide Association Studies
#'
#' A package designed to provide users with easy access to published methods which aim to
#' correct for Winner's Curse using only summary statistics from genome-wide association studies. With merely estimates of effect size and
#' associated standard error for each genetic variant, users are able to implement these methods to obtain
#' more accurate estimates of the true effect sizes. These methods can be applied to data from both
#' quantitative and binary traits.
