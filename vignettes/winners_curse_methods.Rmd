I need to start with a section on creating a dataset, and then illustrate how a user would perform each of the methods on that dataset. First, small introduction to the problem etc., then discuss the creation of a toy simulated dataset which is appropriate for use for each of my functions: 

1. conditional likelihood methods described in Ghosh et al. (2008)
2. empirical bayes method described in Ferguson et al. (2013) - haven't implemented the combination approach suggested in this paper yet
3. FDR Inverse Quantile transformation method of Bigdeli et al. (2016)
