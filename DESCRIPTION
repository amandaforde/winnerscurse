Description: A package designed to provide easy access to published methods which aim to 
  correct for Winner's Curse using only GWAS summary statistics. With merely estimates of beta and 
  associated standard error for each SNP, users are able to implement these methods to obtain 
  less biased estimates of the true beta values. These methods can be applied to data from both 
  quantitative and binary traits.
