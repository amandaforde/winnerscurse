Description: Designed to provide users with easy access to published methods which aim to 
  correct for Winner's Curse using only summary statistics from genome-wide association studies. With merely estimates of effect size and
  associated standard error for each genetic variant, users are able to implement these methods to obtain 
  more accurate estimates of the true effect sizes. These methods can be applied to data from both 
  quantitative and binary traits.
